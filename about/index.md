Short Leg Studio is a game design and media production company with a belief 
that games are for everyone and are a way to bring people together. It doesn't
matter what kind of games you like as much as the fact that you like playing them.

Our [Main Site](http://shortlegstudio.com) has more information on our products, 
coloring books, free stuff, announcements and more!

This is our Development Blog. What we will keep updated here is information on 
games we are making, tools and advice in building your own games, as well as
general programming and possibly a game review or two. 

We hope you enjoy it and we are happy you are here.

*Life is short, Make it fun!*

-Trevor
