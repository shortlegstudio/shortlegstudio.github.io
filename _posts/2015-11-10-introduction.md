I have extensive experience building applications and tools 
for businesses and I have a passion for well crafted games that focus
on replayability and discovery. I want to bring my skills in line with
my passions to create games that provide a fun and thoughtful experience
to the player.

This blog is to cover the journey and learnings and give back all the help
I've received from other bloggers and content creators. You can expect to
read up on the following while here:

 * **Unity for Programmers Series** - I want to create a tutorial or information series
 covering how to approach Unity when you have already learned how to build robust
 applications. Unity is well designed and powerful but like any framework, the
 key is actually finding out how it wants you to work with it. As I learn I will
 be posting my experiences and approaches to building scalable Unity applications.
 * **One Game a Month** - I will be creating a new game each month for at least the 
 next year. These games will all be open source and available for others to review. 
 They are meant to provide a place and focus for me to develop and learn. I won't
 vouch upfront for the quality, but I'm sure there will be useable lessons within them.
 * **Other stuff** - Game reviews, game design, and other more general catagories will be
 visited though with less frequency of the above two.
 
Let's do this!
